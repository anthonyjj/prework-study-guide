# My Website

## Description
Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. I made this website to better my education on coding, I have learned so many things. For instance, I did not know multiple code languages were used to make a HTML website, I thought HTML was only used to make a HTML site.

## Installation
I first downloaded Git then VS code

## Usage
After downloading Git and VS Code, I made a SH Key to link to my github then I made a folder for my project, followed by a feature branch for my HTML. Everythiing I added was followed by a branch before adding into main branch.
